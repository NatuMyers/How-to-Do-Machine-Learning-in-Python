This code is from github.com/natumyers

It uses machine learning to create a classifier for the classical iris data set. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

### Before anything, install: 
 
Follow the install instructions for TensorFlow here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation

Follow the install instructions for SciKit Learn here:
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

### My intention for this: 

This code can be modified to parse though a REST api to obtain data, then the result and prediction could then be posted after the data mining is complete.
